Unlike previous Lego games in which players had to advance through the story in a linear order, players can now choose to start the game from any of the main Skywalker Saga episodes and complete them in any order they wish. Each episode has their own hub filled with planets featured prominently in each respective film that can be visited and explored. Each episode will have five story missions each, a total of 45 levels.
             

              Combat has also been revamped, such as lightsaber fights now involving a variety of combos with light attacks, heavy attacks, and Force moves, and blaster characters having an over-the-shoulder camera angle featured in many third-person shooter games.
             

              Random encounters will also happen in the game's hub. For example, an Imperial Star Destroyer will suddenly jump out of hyperspace and send a fleet of TIE Fighters after the player. Players can choose to engage in dogfights with them or continue onward to progress the story. The game will have more than 200 playable characters, though TT Games has said that number will change.","['This was a trip down memory lane when it comes to the two lego star wars games: the prequel and the original trilogy. Although these were the first two games that I have ever played growing up throughout my childhood instead of playing games that were popular at the time like Halo, Metal Gear Solid, or Half Life. But with that out of the way, The Skywalker Saga is pretty good and fun to play. There are plants you can explore and spaces to travel in between throughout the game that makes it fun. There is one planet however that I started to feel annoyed with its progression and its layout, Kef Bir. That planet was a chore to explore with one transition cutscene between lands and it was annoying. Then there was four floors that I needed to climb and it was a chore when doing main and side missions. Other than that, every planet did not feel boring to explore for collectibles and I am glad that i had my time with it. Not going to mention the Star Wars strories since I have said my part on ROTS, but not the others since I have watched them already. The only thing that affects the rating is the gameplay and that is all I care about. The Lego Skywalker saga was fun, funny, and delightful when it comes to finally closing the chapter on the skywalker saga. If you love the lego star wars games, then you will love this one.', ""On release I would've given this a 5 star rating, but when you finish and want to collect everything there is a severe lack of unique content. A lot of the planets reuse the same methods of collecting items over and over and it begins to feel stale when you finish an entire sector. When you are just playing normally, the experience is great and it is a fun modern LEGO game. It's certainly a great upgrade over the Complete Saga (which is also terrific) and completely redid the combat for the better. Collecting everything can be a major energy drain since there are so many repetitive methods. And some of the planets and hubs are miserable to explore. Also, the tutorials keep popping up even though I've sunk 90+ hours into the game."", 'Once i finished all nine trilogies and did all of the side quest, the game got stale for me tbh, Sorry :P', 'That was certainly a top tier LEGO game (and Star Wars game).

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings.

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills.

Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.

Its plot, characters, and themes are genuinely thought provoking, drawing from a number of different religious and philosophical sources. The battle system is easily one of the most unique among its peers, combining the combos of a fighting game with turn based combat. Combat and exploration are even more fleshed out when you add in the game's mechs. The music and art design are also just as memorable. Xenogears is by no means a perfect game. It is noticeably unpolished and is at times frustrating. Despite these frustrations though, it holds a special place as one of a select few JRPGs that have enriched me as a person.

The frame-rate is actually fine if you were playing it on PC (unlocked even). The only real issue with it is that soft-locks aren't as good as hard-locks in games with crowd-control. The game did well ditching the heavy recycling of stages prevalent in the previous games, and adding platforming-challenges to it in lieu of the awkwardly implement Resident Evil style 'shove silly item into silly hole to open a door' puzzles.

It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020.
             

              The story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII.
             

              Kingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters.","['I quite liked this one, but it\'s certainly not without its faults.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.
             

              The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.
             

              Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","['Sem d√∫vidas, h√° valores espalhados aqui e ali.

Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...
             

              The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.
             

              Levels that have been visited before might become ""Expedition Missions"" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.","['I think...

Sure it has the same core gameplay loop but it's vastly different in terms of storytelling and actually tying the gameplay to the other aspects of the game. Instead of focusing on characters (which this game still does, just not to the extent of other RGG titles) it built an incredible story which just continues to get tighter and more thrilling as the chapters fly by. The side content is some of the best from the entire series and considering that I'm talking about RGG games, that means a lot to me. The side cases and friend quest thingies are mostly outstanding and just really add to the unique feel of Judgement's Kamurocho. Yagami and Kaito are incredibly loveable and special characters that quickly gained a place in my heart. I really believe they are some of the best main characters RGG has created thus far. My only actual nitpick are the minigames which felt a bit bland. Also there was no karaoke so that definitely hurt me. As for the mechanics which get quite a bit of critique online (especially mortal wounds and the tailing missions) I didn't mind too much.

The graphical fidelity and detail here is very high in the sequel not that the first game was by any means ugly in comparison but the changes in scenery and colour on display in this entry are strong. What isn\'t as strong is the structure and puzzles which I was expecting to be more complex and fitting. I think the general premise is great but I was hoping for a lot more in the way of puzzles relating to Amicias sling (which remain as simple as in Innocence), and newer additions like the crossbow. Especially in combat which in the early stages alludes to a concept that should\'ve been explored a lot further something akin to a morality system like in Dishonoured as an example. Here it\'s a narrative tool and discarded as quickly as it\'s brought up but used to hold characters accountable loosely even in the later acts of the game. It\'s a game with great potential to go further in terms of gameplay still, but the story itself has in my opinion pigeonholed itself in regards to what transpire with the De Rune family, and I think more room was needed to explore in a future title. It\'s much the same as the first entry in terms of gameplay with the odd addition in places but nothing new sticks as well as the crossbow which is almost too good I think for the gameplay feel they were going for in the first entry to here. Some iffy dialogue and less engaging puzzles mainly bring the game down but also the structure around everything. It essentially repeats it\'s own first act with a new coat of paint and different (and more interesting) characters. This would be fine but a lot of the tension that came with the first games isolation of Amicia and Hugo at times is lost here though this is replaced with a more ""complex"" cast of villain/s at play than just being purely insidious monsters. I hope for a future release under the franchise with much more varied puzzles and better utilisation of the combat narratively but it works as a good sequel in the end to what was already a good game albeit less surprising and punchy.', 'A total improvement from the first game.

The controls are not intuitive but functional. Amazing OST, great level design, fun weapons. Has moments that exist to sell strategy guides.', ""Not overhyped. But it hasn‚Äôt aged super well either. Personally I feel like this game shows it‚Äôs age after playing it for the first time, the combat especially. But what‚Äôs here is still a decent, if not flawed Metroidvania. Graphically I still think Super Metroid holds up. It has a fantastic art style which I love. And there‚Äôs a reason that people copy it now. It‚Äôs because it fits, and it‚Äôs very versatile in its application. Leading to areas matching a feeling of alien caves to machine fortresses. The graphics hold up super well looking back on this game. And the music too, it really helps set the mood of each area. But tracks like the boss music? Not as good. I really only tended to enjoy the ambient tracks, which are both calm and full of life. Rather than the more intense tracks. Which always comes off as cheesy sci-fi background stuff. However the thing that I think holds up the worst in this game is the combat. Jeez dude, if you‚Äôre someone who likes combat in your adventure games like I do then you‚Äôll be very frustrated with this one. Dodging attacks is guesswork, hitting shots doesn't feel satisfying. The combat is so weak and it made the bosses feel less like challenges and more like‚Ä¶ Flesh walls? Yeah, sure. I‚Äôll go with that. Just something you fire rockets into over and over until they die. It‚Äôs extremely boring. I don‚Äôt think combat was the overall focus though. Most of the abilities are based around platforming and puzzle solving, which is fine. But the problem is the controls of the platforming abilities have aged like milk. The grappling hook is difficult to use because of how the screen scrolls, and the space jump feels so unresponsive. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to tell someone else to jump for me. Leading to both the combat controls and the platforming controls to all be‚Ä¶ Bad. Just kinda bad. And it makes a large majority of the game feel bad too."", ""A young woman is traumatized being pushed into an abortion by her distant cerebral mother, who seeks to have her adoptive daughter permanently institutionalized, when the daughter's return home emboldens her to upgrade her boundaries, and confront her mom, to mourn the loss of a child she wishes could exist as more than a ghost."", 'Super Metroid is an action-adventure game developed by Nintendo in 1994 and published for the SNES.
